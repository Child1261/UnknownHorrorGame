## Desired outcomes
From our project we are hoping to develop some skills relating to expanding our knowledge of game programming, including working with sessions and developing a multiplayer game.

We are also hoping to develop our skills in working as a team, this includes properly communicating what we intend to change, and creating code that is easy to understand by others. 

Learning how to properly utilize version control, in this case Github in order to make changes to our game without causing conflict errors.
